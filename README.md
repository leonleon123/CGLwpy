Conway's Game of Life made with python and tkinter.
I got fascinated by the idea of cellular automatas and decided to code my
own little Conway's Game of Life with python and tkinter as a practice.

There are also my old version without classes and a spinoff version which
just uses a bit different rule, but it isn't really interesting.

 Made with python 3.7.1.
